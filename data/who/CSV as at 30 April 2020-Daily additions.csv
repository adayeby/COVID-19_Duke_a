Evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A global health emergency,"Acter, Thamina; Uddin, Nizam; Das, Jagotamoy; Akhter, Afroza; Choudhury, Tasrina Rabia; Kim, Sunghwan","According to data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, more than two and half million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly discovered virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed on April 20, 2020 (Nature, 2020b). Since the emergence of this infectious disease in Asia (Wuhan, China) late last year, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except Antarctica (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2020). Along with a foothold in every country, the current disease pandemic is disrupting practically every aspect of life all over the world. As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus. This review will be a summa of the key features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020.

"The Human Coronavirus Disease COVID-19: Its Origin, Characteristics, and Insights into Potential Drugs and Its Mechanisms","Alanagreh, Lo’ai; Alzoughool, Foad; Atoum, Manar","The emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept across the world, affecting more than 200 countries and territories. Genomic analysis suggests that the COVID-19 virus originated in bats and transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts in the Wuhan seafood market, China, in December of 2019. This virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus group, the same group of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2. Given the lack of registered clinical therapies or vaccines, many physicians and scientists are investigating previously used clinical drugs for COVID-19 treatment. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the CoVs origin, pathogenicity, and genomic structure, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.

"Review Article: Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19 in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient","Al-Ani, Aysha; Prentice, Ralley; Rentsch, Clarissa; Johnson, Doug; Ardalan, Zaid; Heerasing, Neel; Garg, Mayur; Campbell, Sian; Sasadeusz, Joe; Macrae, Fin; Ng, Siew C.; Rubin, David T.; Christensen, Britt","Summary Background The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a public health emergency. All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. Aim To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. Methods A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarized and critically examined. Results IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. Conclusion IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.",2020,,Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics,n/a,n/a,,,10.1111/apt.15779,25951,#141484,Al-Ani 2020,,,141484,30-04-20

Application of deep learning technique to manage COVID-19 in routine clinical practice using CT images: Results of 10 convolutional neural networks,"Ardakani, Ali Abbasian; Kanafi, Alireza Rajabzadeh; Acharya, U. Rajendra; Khadem, Nazanin; Mohammadi, Afshin","Fast diagnostic methods can control and prevent the spread of pandemic diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and assist physicians to better manage patients in high workload conditions. Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%). ResNet-101 can be considered as a high sensitivity model to characterize and diagnose COVID-19 infections, and can be used as an adjuvant tool in radiology departments.",2020,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,,103795-103795,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103795,25961,#141494,Ardakani 2020,,,141494,30-04-20

Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United Kingdom: A personality-based perspective on concerns and intention to self-isolate,"Bacon, Alison M.; Corr, Philip J.","Objectives Public behaviour change is necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related).

Does lockdown reduce air pollution? Evidence from 44 cities in northern China,"Bao, Rui; Zhang, Achen","Responding to the ongoing novel coronavirus (agent of COVID-19) outbreak, China implemented “the largest quarantine in human history” in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus on 23 January 2020. Human mobility and relevant production and consumption activities have since decreased significantly. As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic—on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively. (2) Mechanism analysis illustrated that the lockdowns of 44 cities reduced human movements by 69.85%, and a reduction in the AQI, PM2.5, and CO was partially mediated by human mobility, and SO2, PM10, and NO2 were completely mediated. (3) Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of green production and consumption.",2020,,Science of The Total Environment,,,139052-139052,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139052,25970,#141503,Bao 2020,,,141503,30-04-20

COVID-19: An Early Review of Its Global Impact and Considerations for Parkinson's Disease Patient Care,"Bhidayasiri, Roongroj; Virameteekul, Sasivimol; Kim, Jong-Min; Pal, Pramod Kr; Chung, Sun-Ju","While many infectious disorders are unknown to most neurologists, COVID-19 is very different. It has impacted neurologists and other health care workers, not only in our professional lives but also through the fear and panic within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and even in the wider public. COVID-19 affects all sorts of individuals, but the elderly with underlying chronic conditions are particularly at risk of severe disease, or even death. Parkinson's disease (PD) shares a common profile as an age-dependent degenerative disorder, frequently associated with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases, so PD patients will almost certainly fall into the high-risk group. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection. It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year's Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant. Though the possibilities presented are speculative, they are theory-based, and supported by prior evidence from other neurotrophic viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Neurologists should be on high alert and vigilant for potential acute and chronic complications when encountering PD patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.",2020,,Journal of movement disorders,,,,,10.14802/jmd.20042,25977,#141510,Bhidayasiri 2020,,,141510,30-04-20

"NSAIDs in patients with viral infections, including Covid-19: victims or perpetrators?","Capuano, Annalisa; Scavone, Cristina; Racagni, Giorgio; Scaglione, Francesco","Taking anti-inflammatory drugs, including non-steroidal (NSAIDs), during Covid-19 infection, how much is risky? The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections. Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.",2020,,Pharmacological Research,,,104849-104849,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104849,25987,#141520,Capuano 2020,,,141520,30-04-20
Skull base surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic: The Italian skull base society recommendations,"Castelnuovo, Paolo; Turri-Zanoni, Mario; Karligkiotis, Apostolos; Battaglia, Paolo; Pozzi, Fabio; Locatelli, Davide on behalf of the Italian Skull Base Society Board; Bernucci, Claudio; Iacoangeli, Maurizio; Krengli, Marco; Marchetti, Marcello; Pareschi, Roberto; Pompucci, Angelo; Rabbiosi, Dimitri","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), is highly contagious with devastating impacts for healthcare systems worldwide. Medical staff are at high risk of viral contamination and it is imperative to know what personal protective equipment is appropriate for each situation. Furthermore, elective clinics and operations have been reduced in order to mobilize manpower to the acute specialties combatting the outbreak; appropriate differentiation between patients who require immediate care and those who can receive telephone consultation or whose treatment might viably be postponed is therefore crucial. Italy was one of the earliest and hardest-hit European countries and therefore the Italian Skull Base Society board has promulgated specific recommendations based on consensus best practices and the literature, where available. Only urgent surgical operations are recommended and all patients should be tested at least twice (on days 4 and 2 prior to surgery). For positive patients, procedures should be postponed until after swab test negativization. If the procedure is vital to the survival of the patient, FFP3 and/or PAPRs devices, goggles, full-face visor, double gloves, water-resistant gowns and protective caps, are mandatory. For negative patients, use of at least FFP2 mask is recommended. In all cases the use of drills, which promote the aerosolization of potentially infected mucous particles, should be avoided.

Which Dermatology Patients Attend to Dermatology Outpatient Clinics During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Turkey and What Happened to Them?,"Cengiz, Fatma Pelin; Emiroglu, Nazan; Bahali, Anil Gulsel; Dizman, Didem; Taslidere, Nazan; Akarslan, Tahsin Cagdas; Gunes, Begum; Mert, Omer; Su Kucuk, Ozlem; Onsun, Nahide","Coronavirus disease, first emerged in Wuhan, rapidly spread all over the World since December 2019. There are concerns about elective dermatology appointments and its results. Herein, we aimed to find out which type of dermatologic patients attended to dermatology outpatient clinic. The patients visiting the clinics for elective dermatologic diseases between 11 and March 18, 2020 were included in this study. Their age, sex, diagnosis of disease, requirement for emergent intervention, and their medical records about COVID-19 were obtained. There were 390 patients attending to the dermatology outpatient clinic in this period. The most common disease was acne (N:94, 24%), only 19% of patients need emergent interventions or dose adjustment. There were 40 (10%) patients over the age of 65. After their visits, 5 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 in two weeks. Dermatologic examinations may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission since being closed to the patient. Five of our patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 after their elective visit to hospital. Since the asymptomatic course of some young patients, most of the our patients weren't screened for COVID-19.

We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.",2020,,Current Cardiology Reports,22,5,34-34,,10.1007/s11886-020-01293-2,25995,#141528,Cheng 2020,,,141528,30-04-20
Pharmacological (or Synthetic) and Nutritional Agonists of PPAR-γ as Candidates for Cytokine Storm Modulation in COVID-19 Disease,"Ciavarella, Carmen; Motta, Ilenia; Valente, Sabrina; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea","The cytokine storm is an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines, due to the over-activation of the innate immune response. This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections. Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-γ also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia. In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-γ, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-γ activation. Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-γ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.",2020,,Molecules,25,9,2076-2076,,10.3390/molecules25092076,25997,#141530,Ciavarella 2020,,,141530,30-04-20

COVID-19 Pandemic: Prevention and Protection Measures to be Adopted at the Workplace,"Cirrincione, Luigi; Plescia, Fulvio; Ledda, Caterina; Rapisarda, Venerando; Martorana, Daniela; Moldovan, Raluca Emilia; Theodoridou, Kelly; Cannizzaro, Emanuele","Introduction: SARS-CoV-2, identified in Wuhan, China, for the first time in December 2019, is a new viral strain, which has not been previously identified in humans; it can be transmitted both by air and via direct and indirect contact; however, the most frequent way it spreads is via droplets. Like the other viruses belonging to the same family of coronaviruses, it can cause from mild flu-like symptoms, such as cold, sore throat, cough and fever, to more severe ones such as pneumonia and breathing difficulties, and it can even lead to death. Since no effective specific drug therapy has been found yet, nor any vaccine capable of limiting the spread of this pathogen, it is important for ways of preventing the spread of this infection to be established. Methods: the purpose of our research was to provide a protocol to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in light of the limited information related to this coronavirus. In detail, we analysed and searched targeted evidence-based guidelines issued in the various countries affected by this epidemic up till now. In addition, we analyzed the recommendations for the prevention and control of other epidemics caused by other pathogens belonging to the same family of coronaviruses or others that present the same mechanisms of transmission. Discussion: general organizational measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency of COVID-19 have been imposed by the competent authorities for an adequate and proportionate management of the evolution of the epidemiological situation. The prevention and protection organizational measures therefore aim to minimize the probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, measures must also be taken at work to avoid new infections or even the spread of the virus where it has already been present. Furthermore, environmental measures are aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to individuals through contact with infected subjects, objects, equipment, or contaminated environmental surfaces. Conclusion: protective devices must be used whenever there is potentially close contact with a suspect case, especially when the potentially infected person does not wear a surgical mask that could reduce the spread of viruses in the environment. By adopting this specific prevention and protection measures recommended in the workplace, it will be possible to help overcome this COVID-19 pandemic.",2020,,Sustainability,12,9,3603-3603,,10.3390/su12093603,25999,#141532,Cirrincione 2020,,,141532,30-04-20
Health workers' safety during tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: Homemade protective screen,"Cordier, Pierre-Yves; De La Villeon, Bruno; Martin, Edouard; Goudard, Yvain; Haen, Pierre","As an aerosol and droplets generating procedure, tracheostomy increases contamination risks for health workers in the coronavirus disease context. To preserve the health care system capacity and to limit virus cross-transmission, protecting caregivers against coronavirus infection is of critical importance. We report the use of external fixator equipment to set up a physical interface between the patient's neck and the caregiver performing a tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Once the metal frame set in place, it is wrapped with a single-use clear and sterile cover for surgical C-arm. This installation is simple, easy, and fast to achieve and can be carried out with inexpensive material available in every hospital. This physical interface is an additional safety measure that prevents the direct projection of secretions or droplets. It should, of course, only be considered as a complement to strict compliance with barrier precautions and personal protective equipment.",2020,,Head & neck,,,,,10.1002/hed.26222,26000,#141533,Cordier 2020,,,141533,30-04-20

Response and role of palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national telephone survey of hospices in Italy,"Costantini, Massimo; Sleeman, Katherine E.; Peruselli, Carlo; Higginson, Irene J.","Background:Palliative care is an important component of health care in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making.Aim:To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries.Design:Cross-sectional telephone survey, in March 2020.Setting:Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 regional prevalence categorised as high (>25), medium (15?25) and low prevalence (<15) COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Analysis was descriptive.Results:Seven high, five medium and four low prevalence hospices provided data. Two high prevalence hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response.Conclusion:The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.

Strategies for daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Dexter, Franklin; Elhakim, Mohamed; Loftus, Randy W.; Seering, Melinda S.; Epstein, Richard H.","We performed a narrative review to explore the economics of daily operating room management decisions for ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that COVID-19 will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.",2020,,Journal of Clinical Anesthesia,,,109854-109854,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109854,26013,#141546,Dexter 2020,,,141546,30-04-20

It’s not over until it’s over: the chameleonic behavior of COVID-19 over a six-day period,"Fichera, Giulia; Stramare, Roberto; De Conti, Giorgio; Motta, Raffaella; Giraudo, Chiara","The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease. Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms. According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays. In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation. Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement. Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.",2020,,La radiologia medica,,,01-Mar,,10.1007/s11547-020-01203-0,26030,#141563,Fichera 2020,,,141563,30-04-20

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is radically altering both socio-economic and health care scenarios. METHODS: On April 4, 2020, at 13.30 CET, a webinar was broadcasted, organized by Global Neuro and supported by WFNS. Expert neurosurgeons from 6 different countries (China, Italy, South Korea, USA, Colombia and United Kingdom) reported on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health care systems and neurosurgical activity. RESULTS: The first part focused on the epidemiology until that date. The USA were the most affected State with 450.000 cases, followed by Italy (140.000 cases and 19.000 casualties), China (83.305 cases and 3.345 had died), South Korea (10.156 cases with 177 casualties), the UK (38.168 cases and 3.605 deaths) and Colombia (1.267 cases and 25 deaths). The second part concerned Institution and staff reorganization. In every country all surgical plans have been modified. In Wuhan the staff was enrolled in COVID-units. In New York, the Mount Sinai Health System was in lockdown mode. In South Korea, sterilizing chambers have been placed. In Italy some Departments were reorganized in a Hub and Spoke fashion. In the Latin American region, they adopted special measures for every case. In the UK a conference center has been used to accommodate intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The third part was about neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Wuhan the main hospital was used for urgent non-COVID patients. In New York the neurosurgeon staff work in ICU as advanced practitioner (APP). In South Korea every patient is screened. In Italy the on-duty Hub neurosurgeons have been doubled. In the Latin American region recommendations have been developed by some neurosurgical societies. In the UK local non-specialists and traumatologists neurosurgical experts are collaborating in terms of best practice. The final part touched upon how to perform safe surgery and re-start after the pandemic. In China elective surgical procedures are performed very carefully. In New York, surgery planning will be based on patient's viral load. In South Korea and in Italy disinfection plans and negative-pressure O.R. were created. In the Latin American region, the aim is to have a rapid testing system. In the UK they have developed flowcharts to guide trauma patient management. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the pandemic scenario was presented as a thought-provoking challenge in all countries which requires tireless efforts for both maintaining emergency and elective neurosurgical procedures.",2020,,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,,,,,10.23736/S0390-5616.20.04994-2,26033,#141566,Fontanella 2020,,,141566,30-04-20

Objectives To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings Methods Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis. Results Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups. Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular).

The common problem for all these studies is what is the optimal dosing regimen and what is the safety associated with said regimen in COVID-19 patients. Our goal was to synthesize all emerging data in real time using state of the art model-based tools and provide the community with a quantitative assessment of various HCQ regimens. As in any model-based analysis, assumptions are inevitable, and all the major ones are listed in our paper.

Emerging Practice Patterns in Vascular Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Hemingway, Jake F.; Singh, Niten; Starnes, Benjamin W.","Objective Ever since the first positive test was identified on January 21, 2020, Washington State has been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on information obtained from Italian surgeons in Milan and given concerns regarding rising case numbers in Washington state, we implemented new vascular surgery guidelines, which canceled all non-emergent surgical procedures and involved significant changes to our inpatient and outpatient workflow. The consequences of these decisions are not yet understood. Methods The division of vascular surgery at Harborview Medical Center immediately instituted new vascular surgery COVID-19 practice guidelines on March 17, 2020. Subsequent clinic, operative, and consult volume was collected over the next 4 weeks and compared to historical averages. Washington state case/death numbers and UW Medicine hospital case volumes were collected from publicly available sources. Results Since March 10, 2020, the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases within the UW Medicine system has increased 1867%, with floor and intensive care unit bed utilization increasing by 120% and 215%, respectively. After instituting our new COVID-19 guidelines, our average weekly clinical volume decreased by 96.5% (43.1 patients to 1.5 per week), our average weekly surgical volume decreased by 71.7% (from 15 cases to 4.25 per week), and our inpatient consultation volume decreased to 1.81 consults per day. 60% of consultations were completed as telemedicine “e-consults” in which the patient was never evaluated in-person. Trainee surgical volume has also decreased by 86.4% for the vascular surgery fellow and 84.8% for the integrated resident. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of “normal” vascular surgical practice in a large academic institution. New practice guidelines effectively reduced operating room utilization and decreased staff and trainee exposure to potential infection, with changes to clinic volume not resulting in an immediate rise in emergency department/inpatient consultations or acute surgical emergencies. These changes, although preserving resources, are also reducing trainee exposure and operative volume significantly, which requires new modes of education delivery.

Perspectives for the use of therapeutic Botulinum toxin as a multifaceted candidate drug to attenuate COVID-19,"Kandasamy, Mahesh","The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resulting from a distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve in many countries and pose life-threatening clinical issues to global public health. While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. Presently, there is an urgent need for a remedial measure to combat this devastating COVID-19. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human. However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.",2020,,Medicine in Drug Discovery,,,100042-100042,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100042,26087,#141614,Kandasamy 2020,,,141614,30-04-20

According to the WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), currently there are no medicines or vaccines that have been claimed to be useful in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Several existing antiviral drugs, previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, are being investigated as COVID-19 treatments and some of them are being used in clinical trials. According to the CDC and Chinese treatment guidelines for COVID-19, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) are recommended in critically ill older patients. The use of other potential drugs reported in different studies may be considered if treatment with first-line drugs is ineffective. There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19. Until now, it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease. Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs.

This impacts patients with dysphagia complications caused by head and neck cancers. As this pandemic of COVID-19 may last longer than SARS in 2003, a practical workflow for managing dysphagia is crucial to ensure a safe and efficient practice to patients and healthcare personnel. This document provides clinical practice guidelines based on available evidence to date to balance the risks of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with the risks associated with dysphagia. Critical considerations include reserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only, optimizing the non-instrumental swallowing evaluation, appropriate use of PPE, and use of telehealth when appropriate. Despite significant limitations in clinical service provision during the pandemic of COVID-19, a safe and reasonable dysphagia care pathway can still be implemented with modifications of setup and application of newer technologies.

Changes in sexual behaviors of young women and men during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: a convenience sample from the epidemic area,"Li, Weiran; Li, Guanjian; Xin, Cong; Wang, Yaochi; Yang, Sen","Background In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. Aim The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people’s sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic and explore the context in which they manifest. Methods A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. Outcomes The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people’s sexual behavior. Results While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. Clinical Implications The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. Strength & Limitations This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. Conclusion During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China.",2020,,The Journal of Sexual Medicine,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.380,26103,#141630,Li 2020,,,141630,30-04-20
Adapting reusable elastomeric respirators to utilise anaesthesia circuit filters using a 3D-printed adaptor; a potential alternative to address N95 shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Liu, D. C. Y.; Koo, T. H.; Wong, J. K. K.; Wong, Y. H.; Fung, K. S. C.; Chan, Y.; Lim, H. S.","Summary The COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for disposable N95 respirators. Re-usable elastomeric respirators may provide a suitable alternative. Proprietary elastomeric respirator filters may become depleted as demand increases. An alternative may be the virus/bacterial filters used in anaesthesia circuits, if they can be adequately fitted onto the elastomeric respirators. In addition, many re-usable elastomeric respirators do not filter exhaled breaths. If used for sterile procedures, this would also require modification. We designed a 3D-printed adaptor that permits elastomeric respirators to interface with anaesthesia circuit filters and created a simple modification to divert exhaled breaths through the filter. We conducted a feasibility study evaluating the performance of our modified elastomeric respirators. A convenience sample of eight volunteers was recruited. Quantitative fit testing, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded during fit testing exercises and after one hour of wear. All eight volunteers obtained excellent quantitative fit testing throughout the trial. The mean (SD) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (0.5) kPa and 4.6 (0.4) kPa at baseline and after one hour of wear (p = 0.148). The mean (SD) respiratory rate was 16 (4) breaths.min-1 and 17 (3) breaths.min-1 at baseline and after one hour of wear (p = 0.435). Four of eight subjects self-reported discomfort; two reported facial pressure, one reported exhalation resistance and one reported transient dizziness on exertion.

Samples were screened for the presence of BCoV by using a commercially available ELISA kit. Furthermore, RT-PCR was carried out on positive samples for confirmation of the presence of N and S specific genes. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out following RT-PCR tests. 7.2% of samples, were positive for BCoV and all stool samples from the South-West, Northeast and West regions of Iran were negative. The results showed that all the strains of coronavirus identified in Iran were completely in independent clusters and that they did not stand in the same cluster as any of the strains identified in other parts of the world.

This review addresses the evolving approach to the laboratory assessment of COVID-19 and discusses how algorithms for testing have been driven, in part, by the demand for testing overwhelming the capacity to accomplish such testing. This review focused on testing in the United States as this testing is evolving whereas in China and other countries such as South Korea testing is widely available and includes both molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 as well as serological testing using both ELISA methodology and lateral flow immunoassay methodology. Although commercial testing systems are becoming available, there will likely be insufficient numbers of such tests due to high demand. Serological testing will be the next testing issue as the COVID-19 begins to subside. This will allow immunity testing as well as will allow the parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak to be defined.

The Aerosol Box was intended to protect healthcare workers performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), specifically tracheal intubation, by providing a physical barrier to droplet and/or aerosol exposure [2]. An increased infection rate has been reported in healthcare workers internationally, particularly when the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been inadequate or when the supply of PPE has been depleted [3]. The Aerosol Box can be made of transparent acrylic or polycarbonate sheeting, and is re-usable after careful decontamination with an appropriate cleansing agent.

Natural product-derived phytochemicals as potential agents against coronaviruses: a review,"Mani, Janice S.; Johnson, Joel B.; Steel, Jason C.; Broszczak, Daniel A.; Neilsen, Paul M.; Walsh, Kerry B.; Naiker, Mani","Coronaviruses are responsible for a growing economic, social and mortality burden, as the causative agent of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and COVID-19. However, there is a lack of effective antiviral agents for many coronavirus strains. Naturally existing compounds provide a wealth of chemical diversity, including antiviral activity, and thus may have utility as therapeutic agents against coronaviral infections. The PubMed database was searched for papers including the keywords coronavirus, SARS or MERS, as well as traditional medicine, herbal, remedy or plants, with 55 primary research articles identified. The overwhelming majority of publications focussed on polar compounds. Compounds that show promise for the inhibition of coronavirus in humans include scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, saikosaponin B2, quercetin, myricetin, caffeic acid, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, and lectins such as griffithsin. Other compounds such as lycorine may be suitable if a therapeutic level of antiviral activity can be achieved without exceeding toxic plasma concentrations.

Introduction: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. Material and method: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale (BRCSS), the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p <0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection.

Employing Drug Delivery Strategies to Create Safe and Effective Pharmaceuticals for COVID-19,"McHugh, Kevin J.","Abstract The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen and corresponding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had an enormous impact on both global health and the daily lives of billions of people worldwide. With a proven vaccine at least a year from being fully tested for safety and efficacy, there may be an opportunity to rapidly repurpose existing drugs in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and improve outcomes for patients already infected with COVID-19. At present, more than 40 different drugs are being explored for efficacy against COVID-19, including antivirals and immune modulating compounds. Unfortunately, many of these drugs are associated with side effects that limit their use to the most severe cases and thereby prevent their use as prophylactics. This commentary describes drug formulation strategies that can be used to maintain the efficacy of these drugs through controlled release, targeted delivery, and non-viral nucleic acid delivery. If successful, these approaches could enable the expanded use of drugs to reduce the mortality of this devastating disease and equip healthcare providers with the tools to accelerate our recovery from this pandemic and improve our response to the next outbreak of a novel pathogenic virus.

Unlike many western countries, the South Korean government has been able to successfully contain the spread of COVID-19 without a harsh forced lockdown of the epicenter of the virus. This article argues that an agile-adaptive approach, a policy of transparency in communicating risk, and citizens' voluntary cooperation are critical factors. This study also suggests that the South Korean government learned costly lessons from the MERS failure of 2015.

The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo – Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to −77.3%), NO2 (up to −54.3%), and CO (up to −64.8%) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen monoxide decreases.

Use of CT and artificial intelligence in suspected or COVID-19 positive patients: statement of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology,"Neri, Emanuele; Miele, Vittorio; Coppola, Francesca; Grassi, Roberto","The COVID-19 pandemic started in Italy in February 2020 with an exponential growth that has exceeded the number of cases reported in China. Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up. In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool. SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients. In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population: an opinion from the point of view of the virus-host relationship,"Oberemok, Volodymyr V.; Laikova, Kateryna V.; Yurchenko, Kseniya A.; Fomochkina, Irina I.; Kubyshkin, Anatolii V.","At the population level, the virus-host relationship is not set up to end with the complete elimination of either or both. Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population.",2020,,Inflammation Research,,,01-Jun,,10.1007/s00011-020-01352-y,26153,#141680,Oberemok 2020,,,141680,30-04-20

We recently reported a laboratory diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time RT-PCR assays using two primer sets, N and N2. On 30–31 January 2020, the protocol and reagents for these assays were distributed to local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan, and nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was started. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

"Nurture to nature via COVID-19, a self-regenerating environmental strategy of environment in global context","Paital, Biswaranjan","Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become the largest pandemic that has affected 210 countries. Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended. However, the self-revival rate of nature shall continue during post-lockdown period and a master plan must be adapted by national and international (mostly political) bodies to revive the Mother Nature completely.",2020,,Science of The Total Environment,,,139088-139088,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139088,26159,#141686,Paital 2020,,,141686,30-04-20

Given the segmentation of extant guidelines concerning precautions and protective equipment for SARS-CoV2, we aimed to provide consolidated recommendations regarding appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in head neck surgery during the COVID-19 era. Methods Guidelines published by international and United States governing bodies were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients. Results High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking. However, extrapolation of recommendations by governing bodies suggest strongly that head and neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions.

Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm. Methods We describe a small-team ?cohorting? protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures. Results A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between Department members but providing comprehensive coverage. Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions. Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures. Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy.

COVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review,"Pascarella, Giuseppe; Strumia, Alessandro; Piliego, Chiara; Bruno, Federica; Del Buono, Romualdo; Costa, Fabio; Scarlata, Simone; Agrò, Felice Eugenio","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here we provide an overview of the known clinical features of and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: ?COVID-19?, ?2019-nCoV?, ?coronavirus? and ?SARS-CoV-2?. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.

High-Value Plant Species Used for the Treatment of “Fever” by the Karen Hill Tribe People,"Phumthum, Methee; Sadgrove, Nicholas J.","The symptom “fever” is generally not itself a terminal condition. However, it does occur with common mild to severe ailments afflicting the world population. Several allopathic medicines are available to attenuate fever by targeting the pathogen or the symptom itself. However, many people in marginal civilizations are obligated to use locally grown medicinal plants due to limited access to common pharmaceuticals. The Karen ethnic group is the biggest ethnic minority group in the hill-tribes of Thailand. They utilise a vast repertoire of medicinal plant species. Since many modern drugs were discovered out of traditional therapies, it is possible to discover new allopathic drugs in the treatment of fever and associated pathogens from the Karen people. Thus, this study aims to identify and record the ethnomedicinal plants they used for the treatment of “fever”. The names of plants used by the Thai Karen people for the treatment of fever were mined from publications on ethnomedicinal uses. Useful plant species and families were identified using the Cultural Importance Index (CI). With the mined data, 125 plant species from 52 families were identified, distributed across 25 Karen villages. A chemical cross-examination of these species provided valuable insights into chemical classes worthy of further investigation in the context of fever and associated pathogens.",2020,,Antibiotics,9,5,220-220,,10.3390/antibiotics9050220,26169,#141696,Phumthum 2020,,,141696,30-04-20
Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19: étude reCoVery,"Plaze, Mario; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-Cécile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chrétien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Raphaël","Résumé OBJECTIFS: La pandémie mondiale actuelle de COVID-19 a touché environ 2 350 000 personnes et fait plus de 160 000 morts. Nous avons observé dans le GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (site Sainte-Anne, Paris, France) une incidence moins importante de formes symptomatiques de COVID-19 chez les patients (environ 4 %) que dans notre personnel soignant (environ 14 % des infirmiers et médecins). Des retours similaires nous sont donnés par les unités psyCOVID en France et à l’étranger. Ces observations nous ont amenés à formuler l’hypothèse que la chlorpromazine (CPZ) pourrait avoir une action prophylactique sur le SARS-CoV-2 et protégeraient les patients des formes symptomatiques et virulentes de cette infection. Cette hypothèse est cohérente avec les propriétés antivirales connues de la CPZ. En plus de ses effets antipsychotiques classiques, plusieurs études in vitro ont également démontré une activité antivirale de cette phénothiazine via l'inhibition de l'endocytose dépendante des clathrines. Récemment, des études ont révélé un effet anti-MERS-CoV et anti-SARS-CoV-1 de la CPZ. MÉTHODES: Dans ce contexte, l’étude ReCoVery, basée sur le repositionnement de la CPZ-molécule avec un excellent profil de tolérance et une biodistribution très élevée dans la salive, les poumons et le cerveau - vise à tester l’hypothèse que la CPZ pourrait diminuer l’évolution défavorable de l’infection COVID-19 chez des patients oxygénorequérants sans nécessité de soins en réanimation mais aussi réduire la contagiosité du SARS-CoV-2. Nous allons réaliser pour cela un essai thérapeutique pilote de phase III multicentrique, randomisé, contrôlé (traitement standard vs. CPZ + traitement standard) et en simple insu. OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comprises a total of more than 2 350 000 cases and 160 000 deaths. The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (∼4 %) compared to health care professionals (∼14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ + standard-of-care (CPZ + SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ + SOC group, compared to the SOC group:  A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its 'LARGe ACTion' properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.",2020,,L'Encéphale,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010,26171,#141698,Plaze 2020,,,141698,30-04-20

Self-removing passive drain to facilitate postoperative care via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Qualliotine, Jesse R.; Orosco, Ryan K.","BACKGROUND: Telehealth postoperative visits are an attractive strategy to minimize exposure, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The use of a surgical drain often prevents this minimal-exposure approach in that patients return to the outpatient clinic for drain removal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following unilateral neck dissection, the customary closed-suction drain was replaced with a self-removing, passive drain dressing to facilitate same-day discharge and telehealth postoperative follow-up. The patient removed the dressing and drain at home during a telehealth visit on postoperative day 4 and she healed favorably without any signs of infection or seroma.

The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities. The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients. In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.

"Estimation of the Excess COVID-19 Cases in Seoul, South Korea by the Students Arriving from China","Ryu, Sukhyun; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Lim, Jun-Sik; Chun, Byung Chul","Background: In March 2020, overall, 37,000 international students from China, a country at risk of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has arrived in Seoul, South Korea. Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in the Korean home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students from China, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and performed a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the number of the infected individuals would reach 40–72 from 12 March–24 March with the arrival of 0.2% of pre-infectious individuals. Furthermore, the number of isolated individuals would peak at 40–64 from 13 March–27 March in Seoul, South Korea. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics by the international student from China were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. Conclusions: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine of the individuals from countries with the virus risk are warranted along with other containment policies.",2020,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,17,9,3113-3113,,10.3390/ijerph17093113,26189,#141716,Ryu 2020,,,141716,30-04-20

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. Methods - Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin from March 1st through the 23rd at three hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in TdP. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation and arrhythmogenic death. Results - Two hundred one patients were treated for COVID-19 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of TdP was not observed in the entire population. Baseline QTc intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) vs. those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) (440.6 ± 24.9 ms vs. 439.9 ± 24.7 ms, p =0.834). The maximum QTc during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group vs the monotherapy group (470.4 ± 45.0 ms vs. 453.3 ± 37.0 ms, p = 0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to QTc prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. Conclusions - In the largest reported cohort of COVID-19 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine {plus minus} azithromycin, no instances of TdP or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy.

China’s metropolises and Italy’s Po Valley have in fact achieved a concerning degree of notoriety thanks to runaway air pollution problems. The spread of viral respiratory diseases is facilitated in polluted environments, an example of which is the respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. In this opinion paper, we consider the possible relationship between air pollution, primarily airborne PM10–2.5, and the spread of the novel coronavirus in Northern Italy. If it is true that the novel coronavirus remains active from some hours to several days on various surfaces, it is logical to postulate that the same can occur when it is adsorbed or absorbed by the atmospheric particulate matter, which may also help carry the virus into the human respiratory system.

Virtual Remote Attending Supervision in an Academic Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Schrading, Walter A.; Pigott, David; Thompson, Linda","ABSTRACT Background As the surge of patients with COVID-19 increased, our academic university faculty needed to explore ways to protect the more vulnerable physicians in the group from infection while maintaining the service to our patients and the educational objectives of our residency training program. Methods We utilized telehealth carts used for other purposes in the institution and the ED to allow the replacement of one physically present supervising attending physician with a virtual remote attending physician. This physician, working from home, can be virtually present for resident history and physicals with all patients in the supervised pod. Discussions about patient care, review of studies, and decision on final disposition can also be performed. Resident teaching can also be accomplished. Results Our innovation represents a novel use of telemedicine capabilities which allows us to protect vulnerable faculty from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining appropriate EM resident supervision and patient care. We found some advantages of this process which allow us to more directly observe the initial resident assessment of the patient. The residents responded favorably to the degree of supervision and patient care that we can provide remotely. Conclusions Our novel use telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed us to decrease the exposure of more vulnerable faculty while maintaining the ability of these faculty to continue to contribute to patient care and resident education. It is well accepted by our residents and seems to be a viable alternative to physical presence in the ED for at least one faculty member. This modality might also be utilized by an attending who fell ill and was not yet able to return to physical work. We hope our description of this process might be useful to other academic departments or community hospital groups who may have at-risk members.",2020,,AEM Education and Training,n/a,n/a,,,10.1002/aet2.10460,26197,#141724,Schrading 2020,,,141724,30-04-20

Can melatonin reduce the severity of COVID-19 pandemic?,"Shneider, Alex; Kudriavtsev, Aleksandr; Vakhrusheva, Anna","The current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.",2020,,International reviews of immunology,,,01-Oct,,10.1080/08830185.2020.1756284,26202,#141729,Shneider 2020,,,141729,30-04-20

Operative team checklist for aerosol generating procedures to minimise exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2,"Soma, Marlene; Jacobson, Ian; Brewer, Jessica; Blondin, Angela; Davidson, Gretel; Singham, Shamani","Objectives In many countries around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in health services being diverted to manage patients with the condition. There are situations however that still require the undertaking of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) with potentially high exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2 transmission through droplet, contact and possibly airborne routes. The objective of this paper is to explore a structured way for the operative team to approach AGP to reduce aerosolisation of secretions, decrease open airway time and minimise staff exposure. Methods The authors (otolaryngologists, anaesthetists and nursing staff) created a unified operative team checklist based on collation of national and international specialty society statements, local state government recommendations, hospital policies and literature review. Simulation was undertaken and the checklist was refined after performing AGP on patients with unknown (presumed positive) COVID-19 status. Results An 8 step operative team checklist is provided describing details for the immediate pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative journey of the patient to encourage healthcare workers to reflect upon and modify usual practice during AGP to mitigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The example of paediatric laryngo-bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes or retrieval of an inhaled airway foreign body is used to illustrate the steps however the checklist structure is modifiable for other AGP and adaptable for local needs.

COVID-19-Pandemie: strukturierte Erweiterung von Beatmungskapazitäten mithilfe von Heimrespiratoren,"Summ, O.; Schute, J.; Byhahn, C.; Kahle, T.; Herrmann, M.; Schulte, C.; Bergold, M. N.; Groß, M.","Aufgrund der aktuellen COVID-19-Pandemie besteht ein Bedarf an rascher Aufstockung von Intensiv- und Beatmungskapazitäten. Lieferzeiten für zusätzliche Intensivrespiratoren sind derzeit jedoch nicht absehbar. Eine Möglichkeit, Beatmungskapazitäten nicht nur für COVID-19-, sondern für alle Beatmungspatienten in Akutkrankenhäusern zu steigern, ist der Einsatz von Heimrespiratoren. Heimrespiratoren sind Turbinenrespiratoren, daher üblicherweise nicht auf den Betrieb mit Druckgasanschlüssen angewiesen und können daher auch in Bereichen außerhalb der klassischen intensivmedizinischen Infrastruktur eingesetzt werden.

Will the antimalarial drug take over to combat COVID-19?,"T.K, Sivabakya; G, Srinivas","China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019. The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide. With a death toll approaching that of China’s SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert. Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak. To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans. This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

While Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) is required for clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, submission for EUA is currently a voluntary process for manufacturers of serologic assays. The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning, given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate, or perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role in during our global response to this pandemic.",2020,,Journal of Clinical Microbiology,,,,,10.1128/JCM.00797-20,26224,#141751,Theel 2020,,,141751,30-04-20

"The experience on COVID-19 and cancer from an oncology hub institution in Milan, Lombardy Region","Trapani, D.; Marra, A.; Curigliano, G.","The rapid outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 related disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19. Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization’s progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our Institution. As of April 2nd, 2020, 110 574 COVID-19 cases and 13 157 deaths have been described in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19, of whom 16.5% were cancer patients. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple co-morbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no co-morbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard of care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range: 42–79 years), and patients carried a median of one co-morbid condition (0–2); two out of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 presentation, and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of cancer patients to treatments, prioritizing the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value, and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients.

Mathematical modeling of the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) taking into account the undetected infections. The case of China,"Ivorra, B.; Ferrández, M. R.; Vela-Pérez, M.; Ramos, A. M.","In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a new θ-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction θ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.",2020,,Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation,,,105303-105303,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105303,26075,#141761,Ivorra 2020,,,141761,30-04-20

Stilbene-based Natural Compounds as Promising Drug Candidates against COVID-19,"Wahedi, Hussain Mustatab; Ahmad, Sajjad; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid","The pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a great threat to public health. Currently, no potent medicine is available to treat COVID-19. Quest for new drugs especially from natural plant sources is an area of immense potential. The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (> -7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex. Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein.

Impact of COVID-19 on blood centres in Zhejiang province China,"Wang, Yongjun; Han, Wenjuan; Pan, Lingling; Wang, Cuier; Liu, Yan; Hu, Wei; Zhou, Huapin; Zheng, Xiaofan","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of people. A 'closed-off management' protocol has been launched nationwide in China to cope with this major public health emergency. However, these procedures may cause a crisis for blood donation and blood supply. In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donation and supply in Zhejiang province, which could provide reference and insight for developing countermeasures in other countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood donor and supply information from 38 blood centres during the Spring Festival of 2019 and 2020 were reviewed. A self-administered questionnaire was carried out. RESULTS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of whole blood donors dropped by 67%. The success rate of recruitment for donations dropped by 60%. Most respondents (81·2%) were worried about the 'possibility of acquiring COVID-19 during blood donation'. The total amount of RBCs supply dropped by 65%. In the first week of the outbreak, the weekly amount of issued RBC units (10171·5 u) was almost six times higher than the collected units (1347·5 u). The mean haemoglobin value for RBCs transfusion was about 6·3 g/dl. About 4% of RBCs and 2·8% of frozen plasma were used in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The secondary consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are blood shortages caused by the unavailability of blood donors, and this is likely to be replicated in many countries with high burdens of COVID-19. Practical actions to broaden sources and reduce use for the global crisis must be taken proactively.",2020,,Vox sanguinis,,,,,10.1111/vox.12931,26241,#141773,Wang 2020,,,141773,30-04-20

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Findings Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.

How an Epidemic Outbreak Impacts Happiness: Factors that Worsen (vs. Protect) Emotional Well-being during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Yang, Haiyang; Ma, Jingjing","What are the factors that worsen (vs. protect) emotional well-being during a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19? Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N1 = 11,131; N2 = 3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational concerns (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals’ perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables. In conclusion, public policies and mental health interventions aimed at boosting/protecting psychological well-being during epidemic outbreaks should take account of these factors.",2020,,Psychiatry Research,,,113045-113045,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113045,26253,#141786,Yang 2020,,,141786,30-04-20

The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45%), glycosides (15%), carboxylic acids (10%), and saponins (5%). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, changes in content of major compounds in MXSG during decoction were found by the chemical analysis. We also validate that one major compound in MXSG, i.e. glycyrrhizic acid, inhibited TLR agonists induced IL-6 production in macrophage. In conclusion, the integration of in silico and experimental results indicated that the therapeutic effects of QFPD against COVID-19 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG, which supports the rationality of the compatibility of TCM.",2020,,Pharmacological Research,,,104820-104820,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104820,26254,#141787,Yang 2020,,,141787,30-04-20

However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. Results Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23–8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL. Conclusion These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19. But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.

As of February 19th, 2020, there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in Shanghai, China. This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID-19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference. Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years. 299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms. 139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively. 148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan. The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was December 28th, with the peak appearing on January 27th. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days. 207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization. 56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased c-reactive protein after onset. Elderly, male, and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia. These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia. Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia. Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai?s first-level public health emergency response.

Comparison of Four Molecular <i>In Vitro</i> Diagnostic Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Specimens,"Zhen, Wei; Manji, Ryhana; Smith, Elizabeth; Berry, Gregory J.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first discovered in December 2019 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population. Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19 positive patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients: the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Modified CDC), the Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (Diasorin Molecular), GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 assay (GenMark) and the Hologic Panther Fusion® SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic).

Currently, the mainstream diagnostic methods are imaging and laboratory diagnosis, which differ in their efficacy of diagnosis. To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis. The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697).

Treatment of Proximal Femoral Fragility Fractures in Patients with COVID-19 During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy,"Catellani, Francesco; Coscione, Andrea; D’Ambrosi, Riccardo; Usai, Luca; Roscitano, Claudio; Fiorentino, Gennaro","Background: From February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system. Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient. Methods: Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. Results: Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome. Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient). Conclusions: We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.

Is the Collapse of the Respiratory Center in the Brain Responsible for Respiratory Breakdown in COVID-19 Patients?,"Gandhi, Sonu; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana; Tripathi, Prem Prakash","Following the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, we are now again facing a global highly pathogenic novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. Although the lungs are one of the most critically affected organs, several other organs, including the brain may also get infected. Here, we have highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory bulb. From the olfactory bulb, SARS-CoV-2 may target the deeper parts of the brain including the thalamus and brainstem by trans-synaptic transfer described for many other viral diseases. Following this, the virus might infect the respiratory center of brain, which could be accountable for the respiratory breakdown of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to screen the COVID-19 patients for neurological symptoms as well as possibility of the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem should be investigated in depth.",2020,,ACS Chemical Neuroscience,,,,,10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00217,26296,#141829,Gandhi 2020,,,141829,30-04-20

Home Surgical Skill Training Resources for Obstetrics and Gynecology Trainees During a Pandemic,"Hoopes, Sarah; Pham, Truce; Lindo, Fiona M.; Antosh, Danielle D.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a unique educational circumstance in which medical students, residents, and fellows find themselves with a gap in their surgical training. We reviewed the literature, and nine categories of resources were identified that may benefit trainees in preventing skill decay: laparoscopic box trainers, virtual reality trainers, homemade simulation models, video games, online surgical simulations, webinars, surgical videos, smartphone applications, and hobbies including mental imagery. We report data regarding effectiveness, limitations, skills incorporated, cost, accessibility, and feasibility. Although the cost and accessibility of these resources vary, they all may be considered in the design of remote surgical training curricula during this unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 Response in the Global Epicenter: Converting a New York City Level 1 Orthopedic Trauma Service into a Hybrid Orthopedic and Medicine COVID-19 Management Team,"Konda, Sanjit R.; Dankert, John F.; Merkow, David; Lin, Charles C.; Kaplan, Daniel J.; Haskel, Jonathan D.; Behery, Omar; Crespo, Alexander; Ganta, Abhishek","The SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented challenges on the health care system in the United States with New York City at its epicenter. By the end of the 8th week (4/23/2020) since the virus’s emergence in New York City, there have been 142,432 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,977 deaths attributed to complications from COVID-19-related illnesses. Secondary to policies enacted by the New York State government to limit spread of the virus, Orthopedic Surgery departments at hospitals around the area have witnessed an abrupt change in clinical demands. At a local level one trauma hospital in Queens, New York, Orthopedic Surgery elective cases have been cancelled, trauma consult volume has experienced a sharp decline, and both residents and attendings have been repurposed to meet the new clinical demands of this medical crisis. Our own orthopedic surgery service has adopted care for patients normally admitted to an internal medicine service in a novel Ortho-Medical COVID-19 management team. We prepared this primer to make our experience with caring for COVID-19 patents available as a reference for other surgical subspecialty services preparing to adjust the clinical focus of their hospital teams during this or future pandemics.

Medical Students Are Not Essential Workers: Examining Institutional Responsibility During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Menon, Anitha; Klein, Edwin J.; Kollars, Kate; Kleinhenz, Alissa L.W.","In light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) released a joint statement in March 2020 recommending an immediate suspension of medical student participation in direct patient contact. As graduating medical students who will soon begin residency, the authors fully support this recommendation. Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not. Students’ continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment. By decreasing non-essential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to “flatten the curve.” The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety. Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to “flatten the curve” supersedes usual teaching responsibilities. Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines. The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be utilized as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.

Is COVID Evolution Due to Occurrence of Pulmonary Vascular Thrombosis?,"Saba, Luca; Sverzellati, Nicola","In this hypothesis paper, we suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may induce intravascular pulmonary thrombosis, which may result in the rapid worsening of clinical conditions and, eventually, exitus. Previously published papers have demonstrated that increased levels of D-dimer at hospital admission correlate with a more severe disease (0.5 mg/L) or occurrence of death (1 mg/L). The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement. If this hypothesis is demonstrated, this could suggest the benefit of using antithrombotic/coagulation regimens for SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, the urgency to identify drugs that could alter the inflammatory storm, thus protecting the vessel wall.

"Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement on Reporting Chest CT Findings Related to COVID-19.

However, the number of CTs performed in persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 has increased. We also anticipate that some patients will have incidentally detected findings that could be attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring radiologists to decide whether or not to mention COVID-19 specifically as a differential diagnostic possibility. We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19. When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection. These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. In this setting, using the term “viral pneumonia” can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative. However, if one opts to use the term “COVID-19” in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language. In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide. Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach. The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this pandemic.
